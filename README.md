# JADE-HelloWorldAgent

## JAVA Agent DEvelopment Framework
is an open source platform for peer-to-peer agent based applications

JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) is a software Framework fully implemented in the Java language. It simplifies the implementation of multi-agent systems through a middle-ware that complies with the FIPA specifications and through a set of graphical tools that support the debugging and deployment phases. A JADE-based system can be distributed across machines (which not even need to share the same OS) and the configuration can be controlled via a remote GUI. The configuration can be even changed at run-time by moving agents from one machine to another, as and when required. JADE is completely implemented in Java language and the minimal system requirement is the version 5 of JAVA (the run time environment or the JDK).

All the information to run HelloWorld example is given in the [Wiki](https://github.com/nauyan/JADE-HelloWorldAgent/wiki) page of the repository.
